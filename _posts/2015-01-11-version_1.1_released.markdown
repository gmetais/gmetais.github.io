[Yellow Lab Tools][YellowLab.tools] can now be automated!
-----------------------------------------------------------

## The new v1.1 version contains a major internal refactor

I'm very happy to present this new version! Many changes, but not many of them will be visible on the online service because it's a big code refactor. It transforms the initial Proof of Concept architecture into a more durable one and it adds possibilities for developers (you!) to automate the tool.

##### Yellow Lab Tools can now be used:
- as a NodeJS module ([documentation](https://github.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools/wiki/NodeJS-module))
- from the Command Line ([documentation](https://github.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools/wiki/Command-Line-Interface))
- as a public API ([documentation](https://github.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools/wiki/Public-API))
- and still as an online service ([http://yellowlab.tools](http://yellowlab.tools))

##### The online service also includes new features:
- The front-end is now a real Single Page Application, you can go back and forward with your browser buttons.
- A global score is calculated from all the rules. This is great!
- The *Grades* page was renamed *Dashboard* is now the default result page.
- Every rule now has a color-bullet grade on the Dashboard.
- The dashboard displays 1, 2 or 3 warning icons on a rule if there is a real problem.
- Clicking on the rule directs you to a page that describes the rule and shows the offenders.

##### And Phantomas was upgraded to v1.8, bringing new features:
- New rule: **DOM queries without result**.
- New **Small requests** category, reporting small JS, CSS or image files that could be inlined, concatenated, sprited...
- Embedded `<style>` are now analyzed by css-analyze.
