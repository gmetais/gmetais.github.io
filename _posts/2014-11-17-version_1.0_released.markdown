[Yellow Lab Tools][YellowLab.tools] is officially released!
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a tool designed to help developers audit their website and detect performance or quality problems. This first version is very Javascript oriented. It will diversify in the future.


No installation is required, it's an online tool. Simply go to [http://yellowlab.tools][YellowLab.tools], enter the URL of a webpage and wait for the results.

Help needed:
------------
 - I'm currently looking for help in correcting the english wordings in the tool, as it is not my native language.
 - I also need user feedback. Please report any bug or problem on the project's [GitHub page][github/yellowlabtools].
