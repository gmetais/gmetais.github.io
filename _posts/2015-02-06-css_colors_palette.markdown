Keep an eye on the number of different colors in your CSS
---------------------------------------------------------

New in V1.2.0, [Yellow Lab Tools][YellowLab.tools] now retrieves the list of colors defined in CSS on a page from analyze-css (by [@macbre][@macbre]). It then transforms the list in a nice colors palette, where each color is sized by number of occurrences.

1. Go to [Yellow Lab Tools][YellowLab.tools]

2. Enter the URL of a webpage

3. Once the test is complete, click on the "Different colors" line.
